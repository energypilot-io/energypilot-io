## Quick Start

Using [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/):

1. Copy the below docker compose example and update as needed:

```yml
services:
    energypilot-io:
        container_name: energypilot-io
        build:
            context: .
        environment:
            NODE_ENV: production
        volumes:
            # For persisting EnergyPilot's databases and common configuration
            - ./data/:/data
        ports:
            # Default Web UI Port
            - '3000:3000/tcp'
        restart: unless-stopped
```

2. Run `docker compose up -d` to build and start EnergyPilot.io (Syntax may be `docker-compose` on older systems).

> [!NOTE]
> Volumes are recommended for persisting data across container re-creations for updating images.
